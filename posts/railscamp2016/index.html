                        <p>I attended Railscamp 2016 in Wellington NZ last weekend. Just wanted to collect a couple of notes on some stuff I saw there.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/terrcin/25944057056/in/pool-2957873@N23/" title="NZ Rails Camp 2016"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1492/25944057056_8871390f92_c.jpg" width="800" height="245" alt="NZ Rails Camp 2016"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<ul>
<li>The location was YMCA Camp Kaitoke, which was a really awesome venue. There was a lot of really awesome beer from local breweries too! Really good other drinks and stuff. Just above is a view from the deck of the main area.</li>
<li>Saw an interesting talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/raquelxmoss">@raquelxmoss</a> about &ldquo;Creating a welcoming space for beginners&rdquo;, she wrote up some notes here: <a href="http://www.raquelmoss.com/creating-a-welcoming-space-for-beginners/">http://www.raquelmoss.com/creating-a-welcoming-space-for-beginners/</a></li>
<li>I got a chance to have a chat with Raquel about increasing diversity in the programming/IT/Tech industry. I realize that I am bad at this and would like to help (well, atleast not scare away women from learning and/or being included in technology stuff). Raquel also linked me to really useful resource here:  <a href="http://conference.hopper.org.nz/">http://conference.hopper.org.nz/</a> which I must study soon.</li>
<li>Saw a really interesting talk from <a href="https://twitter.com/terrcin">@terrcin</a> about &ldquo;Monday Madness! or Why we don&rsquo;t use Scrum, and what we do instead&rdquo;. He ran the same talk for the Auckland Ruby meetup, which I was unable to make it to due to something coming up last minute. That was a shame, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing slides soon as I thought there were a bunch of really awesome ideas there.</li>
<li>There was a strong interest in Elixir and Phoenix. On the last night the question was asked: &ldquo;Who has worked on or thought about Elixir/Phoenix stuff this weekend&rdquo; with approximately <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the room putting up their hands. Maybe we are going to see a mass surge in use soon&hellip; I think aside from Machine Learning, Elixir is the next thing I want to learn - it has a lot of really interesting stuff, and seems really pretty easy to learn and understand. Also thee were a few talks about it, like this from Nigel who works for AddressFinder: <a href="http://blog.addressfinder.com.au/post/141506070132/elixir-new-tool-in-the-toolkit">http://blog.addressfinder.com.au/post/141506070132/elixir-new-tool-in-the-toolkit</a></li>
<li>Warewolf (the game) was extremely popular, and many games were played. I think Railscamp is a little bit of a misnomer, maybe something like &ldquo;Beer and Warewolf camp&rdquo; might be more accurate. It was really a great time.</li>
<li>The Ruby NZ AGM was held - that was kind of interesting. Cool to see a proper organization that &ldquo;fosters and supports the Ruby programming language, its users and community in New Zealand&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Also - <a href="http://artctrl.me/posts/nzrailscamp.html">Art of Railscamp</a></li>
<li>Couple random pictures on Flickr here: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/2957873@N23/">https://www.flickr.com/groups/2957873@N23/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So as a full time Go developer now with very little to do with Ruby, why did I go to Railscamp? Because the Ruby community is <strong>awesome</strong>. I definitely want to go to future events! Thanks to the organisers and everyone else for making it a great long weekend.</p>
